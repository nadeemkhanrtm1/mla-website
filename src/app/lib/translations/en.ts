Such institutions play a crucial role in shaping responsible citizens and empowering rural Bengal through education. Supporting schools, teachers, and students is not just a duty — it is an investment in the future of Khanakul and West Bengal.`,

Addressing the massive gathering, the Prime Minister strongly highlighted the failures of the Trinamool regime, stating that under their rule, the safety of daughters is at risk, the education system has fallen into the hands of mafias, and thousands of teachers have lost their jobs. He appealed directly to the mothers and sisters of Bengal, asserting that true security and dignity are possible only when Trinamool is removed from power.
He emphasized that every single vote for BJP is a vote against corruption, fear, and lawlessness, assuring that incidents like Sandeshkhali and large-scale job losses will not be repeated under a BJP-led government. Calling upon the people to take a collective pledge, he said, "Change is necessary — Bengal needs BJP governance."
Beginning his address with "Jai Sri Ramakrishna Dev, Jai Maa Sarada," the Prime Minister paid his respects to Singur's holy soil. The presence of mothers, farmers, youth, and working citizens reflected a growing momentum — a new chapter is being written in Bengal's political history. He also highlighted BJP's commitment to Bengal's culture, mentioning how Durga Puja received UNESCO's Cultural Heritage recognition due to BJP's efforts.`,

Khanakul witnessed an inspiring display of youth power as we successfully organised the Run For Youth Marathon, bringing together young participants from across the constituency.
Running from Ramnagar to Chakpur, the marathon was not just about physical endurance — it was a statement of confidence, discipline, and determination. Our young boys and girls proved that Khanakul's youth are strong, focused, and ready to lead from the front.
Later in the day, I also participated in the Hindu Sammelan at the Marokhana region of Khanakul Assembly, where community unity, cultural values, and social harmony were reaffirmed.
These initiatives reflect a clear commitment — empowering youth, strengthening society, and building a confident future for Khanakul.`,

The main aim of this programme was simple — to listen carefully to people and work for real solutions. These meetings showed that people's voices matter the most, and strong leadership begins by listening at the grassroots level.

This programme highlighted the growing public support for positive change and strengthened the collective resolve to work towards development, safety, and dignity for all.

          descriptionHtml: `Under the leadership of MLA Susanta Ghosh, a major drainage infrastructure project worth approximately ₹27 lakh was implemented in the Arambagh region through the BJP-led Panchayat Samiti.
For several years, residents and traders in the local market area had faced severe waterlogging problems, especially during monsoon seasons. Poor drainage had caused damage to shops, disrupted daily life, and created health hazards. The new drainage system was designed to provide a permanent solution to this long-standing civic issue.
This initiative reflects a strong commitment to grassroots development, urban sanitation, and sustainable infrastructure. By prioritising essential civic amenities, the project aims to improve living conditions, strengthen local business activity, and enhance public health standards in the region.
